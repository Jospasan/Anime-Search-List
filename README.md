DESCRIPTION:

***THE WORK IS NOT MINE ALONE***

This project was built and created with the work of 3 people: Chelsea Nguyen, Joseph Schley, and Danilo Inestroza.

This program sorts a dataset from MyAnimeList using both Radix sort and QuickSort algorithms and allows the user to search by keyword/title, genre, and release year then returning the top five results for the given input.

HOW TO RUN:

1. Download gcc and setup the PATH enviorment.
2. Download all the files in main branch and place them in a folder with desired name (say "anime-search").
3. Place said folder in desired directory (say Desktop).
4. Open Terminal (MacOS) or CMD (Windows) and change the directory to the path of the folder created in step 2 (Ex. Desktop/anime-search/)
5. Run the command "g++ -std=c++14 -o main.exe *.cpp".
6. Run the command "./main.exe".
7. That's it the program should be running. Now, just follow the on-screen program instructions.

NOTES:

Depending on what IDE/compiler the program is ran in some symbols might be displayed correctly.
